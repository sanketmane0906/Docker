There are 3 ways to generate docker image of our existed microservice :-

1) using Dockerfile:-

	The Dockerfile is the most common way to create a Docker image by defining instructions for building the container.

		Steps:
			i) Create a Dockerfile in your project directory.
			ii) Define the base image and necessary instructions.
			ii) Build the image using the docker build command.

         	Pro's :

			* Highly customizable.
			* Efficient layer caching.
			* Industry standard.



2) Using docker commit (From a Running Container) :-

         You can create a Docker image from an existing running container by using docker commit.

      		Steps:
			i) Start a base container.
			ii) Install necessary dependencies manually.
			iii) Commit the container as a new image.

		Pro's :

			* Fast for quick modifications.
			* No need to write a Dockerfile.

		Con's :

			* Not reproducible (hard to track changes).
			* No layer caching (less efficient).




3. Using docker save and docker load (Prebuilt Image Tar Files) :-

 	  If you already have a prebuilt image, you can generate and distribute it using docker save and docker load.



		Pro's :

			* Useful for offline distribution.
			* Works well for exporting/importing images.

  		Con's :

			* Doesn't support modifications (must be prebuilt).
			* Not ideal for development workflows.
