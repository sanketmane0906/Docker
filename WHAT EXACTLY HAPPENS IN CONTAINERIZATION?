Containers are based on the concept of operating system (OS) virtualization, where multiple containers can run on the same physical or virtual machine, sharing the same OS kernel. 
This differs from traditional virtualization, where each virtual machine (VM) runs a separate OS instance.

In containerization, Linux features such as namespaces and cgroups play a crucial role in providing isolation and resource management. Here's a brief explanation of these concepts:

NAMESPACES
Linux namespaces allow for the creation of isolated environments within the operating system. 
Each container has its own set of namespaces, including process, network, mount, IPC (interprocess communication), and user namespaces. 
These namespaces ensure that processes within a container are only aware of and can interact with resources within their specific namespace, providing a level of isolation.

CONTROL GROUPS
cgroups provide resource management and allocation capabilities for containers.
They allow administrators to control and limit the resources (such as CPU, memory, disk I/O, and network bandwidth) that containers can consume. 
By using cgroups, container runtimes can enforce resource restrictions and prevent one container from monopolizing system resources, ensuring fair allocation among containers.
