What is port mapping in docker?

        by default containers are connected to the isolated network with the docker host If you want to access that container you have to do port mapping explicitly

        syntax of docker run command :-

                   docker run -p <host_port>:<container_port> <image_name>

                          host_port → The port on your local machine (host) where you want to access the container.
                          container_port → The port inside the container that the application is listening on
