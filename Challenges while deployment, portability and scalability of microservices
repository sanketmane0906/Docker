* The main challenges are of microservices are :-

1. Deployment Portability Challenges :-
Portability ensures that microservices can run across different environments (development, testing, production) without modification. 

Challenges include:

I)Environment Differences: -
                         Microservices may work in one environment but fail in another due to OS differences, dependency mismatches, or configuration variations.
II)Dependency Management: 
                         Managing multiple dependencies across microservices becomes complex, especially with different libraries, runtime versions, or databases.
III)Containerization Issues: -
                         While Docker and Kubernetes improve portability, differences in networking, storage, or resource allocation across cloud providers can cause failures.
IV)Configuration Management: -
                         Microservices often rely on environment-specific configurations (database URLs, API keys), requiring tools like Consul, Spring Cloud Config, or Kubernetes                             ConfigMaps.
V)Stateful vs. Stateless Services: -
                         Stateless services are easier to port, but stateful microservices (those dependent on databases, caching layers) introduce migration challenges.
VI)Inter-Service Communication: -
                          Services need to interact seamlessly across different environments, requiring a proper API gateway and service discovery.


2. Deployment Scalability Challenges:-
Scalability ensures that microservices can handle increased load efficiently. Challenges include:

I)Load Balancing: -
                         Distributing requests across multiple instances while maintaining session persistence.
II)Database Scalability:
                         Microservices often have separate databases, and ensuring horizontal scaling (sharding, replication) is complex.
III)Resource Management: -
                         Efficient CPU and memory allocation to prevent over-provisioning or under-utilization.
IV)Network Bottlenecks: -
                         High inter-service communication can increase latency and degrade performance, requiring solutions like gRPC or message queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ).
V)Service Discovery & Auto-Scaling: -
                         Dynamically adjusting the number of instances based on traffic load is crucial but complex to configure in Kubernetes or cloud environments.
VI)Data Consistency & Synchronization: -
                         Ensuring eventual consistency in distributed systems, especially for transactions spanning multiple microservices.
VII)Monitoring & Logging: -
                         Handling distributed logging, tracing, and monitoring with tools like Prometheus, ELK Stack, or Jaeger.

* So if we what to overcome these challenges so  we have to use containerization :-

	We converting maven project into the container.
	These container are small in nature which offer self-isolated environment for application including all dependencies.
	We will use docker for containerization of our application.
