Docker Client (CLI & Remote API)

This is what you, as a user, interact with.
You use commands (like docker run, docker build) in the terminal or through a graphical interface to manage Docker.
It sends your commands to the Docker Server.


Docker Host/Server (Docker Daemon)

This is the engine that runs Docker.
It listens to commands from the client and performs actions like creating, running, and managing containers.
Itâ€™s like the brain that controls everything.

Containers & Images

Images are like blueprints (pre-packaged applications with everything they need to run).
Containers are running instances of these images.
The server uses images to create containers where your applications run.

Docker Registry (Docker Hub & Private Registry)

A storage place for Docker images.
Public registries (like Docker Hub) have thousands of ready-to-use images.
Private registries store images securely for personal or enterprise use.
The Docker Server pulls images from here when needed.
