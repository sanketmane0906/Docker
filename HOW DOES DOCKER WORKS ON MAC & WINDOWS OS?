When you install Docker on a Linux OS, you receive the complete Docker Engine on your Linux host. 
However, if you opt for Docker Desktop for Mac or Windows, only the Docker client is installed on your macOS or Windows host.

Behind the scenes, a lightweight virtual machine is configured with Linux, and the Docker server component is installed within that virtual machine.

As a user, your experience will be very similar to using Docker on a Linux machine, with minimal noticeable differences. 
However, when you utilize the Docker CLI to execute commands, you are actually interacting with a Docker server running on a separate machine, which in this case is the Linux-based virtual machine.

To confirm this configuration, you can start Docker and execute the docker version command. 
You will observe that the Docker client is running on the darwin/amd64 architecture (on macOS) or windows/amd64 (on Windows), 
while the Docker server is operating on the linux/amd64 architecture.
